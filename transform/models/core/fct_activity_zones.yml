      For instance, if heart rate data is captured for an activity,
      there will be 5 rows representing the 5 different heart rate zones
      (and the time spent in them during the activity).
      Same with respect to the other zone types of power and pace.
    columns:
      - name: activity_zone_id
        tests:

          - not_null

          "The name of the zone (e.g. 'Z2' for zone two)"
